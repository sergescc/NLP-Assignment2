There are 167 Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) in Cornwall ( including the Isles of Scilly ) .
Cornwall , in the south-west of England , UK, has a population of 545,335 ( mid-2014 est . ) across an area of 3,546 km2 (876,235.7 acres ) , making it one of the least densely populated counties within England .[1 ]
The north coast of Cornwall falls on the Celtic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean , which also surrounds the Isles of Scilly , the south coast falls on the English Channel and the county is bounded by the River Tamar , forming the border with Devon , to the east .
Cornish geology consists mainly of rocks from the Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods .
Granite forms a large part of these , with mineralisations of tin , copper , lead and arsenic having been mined in the area .[2 ]
This gives rise to many distinct habitats , with strong marine influences , including sand dunes , rocky reefs , stacks and headlands as well as heathland , moorland and unusual river profiles .[3 ]

In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is Natural England , which chooses a site because of its fauna , flora , geological or physiographical features .[4 ]
Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature , parts of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service .
Natural England , like its predecessor , uses the 1974â€“96 county system[5 ] and as such the same approach is followed here , rather than adopting the current local government or ceremonial county boundaries .

Of the 167 sites designated in this Area of Search , the greatest number , 81 , have been designated due to their biological interest , with 54 due to their geological interest and 32 for both .[6 ]
The data in the table is taken from English Nature in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.[7 ]
