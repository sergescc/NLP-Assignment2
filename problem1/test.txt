This homework is a programming assignment.  You can use any programming
language you are comfortable with, but make sure your code runs on the class
server:  129.63.16.131.  You will need to submit both your source code and the
binaries, if applicable.  If you use an interpreted language, please make sure that
your code is compatible with the resources installed on the server.  If you need
to install any additional software, please notify me.
Grading criteria; This homework will be graded based on correctness of the
output.  Please document your code and structure it well if you'd like to enable
me to assign partial credit.
